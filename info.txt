Title:

A User Friendly Website to Guide First Time Airmen

 

Synopsis:

This website will be a way to guide airmen, while saving the Air Force bandwidth, and resources, while being a centralized means to delivering publicly accessible resources needed for various tasks in one central location.

Problem:

As a first time airmen, it feels overwhelming trying to find resources on Air Force provided websites. Sometimes you can't find what you're looking for or you don't know what to look at. Sometimes the Air Force portal breaks, provides broken links, doesn't load right, out of date information, plentiful redirects, or sometimes you can't access the sites at all (lost CAC, locked CAC, no access to a CAC reader).

Solution:

A website designed to help and guide airmen to settle in, setup their internet, in-process or out-process, some publicly accessible contacts such as the education office, finance, base exchange, hospital, etc.

This website will help guide and provide resources to airmen to help achieve goals such as:

-Joint Ops (JCU, Deploy)

-Progression (SKT Writer, CDC writer, certs)

-DSD (First Sergeant, MTI, FTAC, MTL, Dorm Manager, instructor, recruiter, CAA)

-Career Path (Ops Superintendent, flight chief, NCOIC, CAG, WHCA, Supervisor, Cross training, etc)

-Commissioning programs (SLECP, NECP, OTS, SOAR, AFA)

-Staff Jobs (Wg/Gp CCC Exec., Protocol, PA, UTM, UDM, RA)

-Inter-service transfer (Palace chase/front, blue to green, etc)

-Continuing education (BA/BS, 7 or 5 level, CCAF, BTZ, CDC, etc)

All the while saving the Air Force money, bandwidth, and resources.
